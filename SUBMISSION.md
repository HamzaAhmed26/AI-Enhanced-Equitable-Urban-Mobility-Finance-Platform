**Bounty**: Ill right the Rules (750 USDC)  
**Sponsor**: Stellar  
**Team**: UK AI Agent Hackathon Ep2 Team  
**Submission Date**: January 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

We have built a comprehensive AI-enhanced equitable urban mobility finance platform using Stellar's Soroban smart contracts. Our solution addresses the critical problem of urban mobility inequities by using AI-driven equitable loan rates and transparent revenue distribution to finance shared urban mobility assets in underserved communities.

### Problem Statement
In major cities, low-income communities face unequal access to affordable, sustainable transportation due to:
- High costs and biased loan approvals
- Centralized ride-sharing platforms
- Traditional finance excluding many from investing in shared mobility solutions

### Our Solution
A decentralized platform on Stellar's Soroban that:
- Crowdfunds mobility assets via community loans
- Uses AI oracles to adjust interest rates equitably (lower for underserved areas)
- Distributes ride revenues transparently with social impact bonuses
- Prioritizes equitable access to urban mobility

## 🔧 AI Tool Usage

### OpenZeppelin AI Wizard
**Prompt Used:**
```
Generate a Rust Soroban smart contract for a lending pool that accepts XLM/USDC deposits, 
integrates an AI oracle for equitable rate adjustments based on urban data, and distributes 
ride revenues with equity bonuses. Include comments and testnet compatibility.
```

### Stella AI Integration
**Prompts Used:**
1. **Core Contract Generation:**
   ```
   Write a Rust Soroban smart contract for a lending pool that accepts XLM/USDC deposits, 
   integrates an AI oracle for equitable rate adjustments based on urban data, and distributes 
   ride revenues with equity bonuses. Include comments and testnet compatibility.
   ```

2. **Governance Enhancement:**
   ```
   Extend the Soroban lending contract with a DAO voting mechanism where votes are weighted 
   by equity scores from an AI oracle. Use Rust and ensure Soroban compatibility.
   ```

3. **Test Case Generation:**
   ```
   Generate Rust test cases for a Soroban lending contract, testing deposit, AI-adjusted 
   loan rates, and equitable revenue distribution.
   ```
