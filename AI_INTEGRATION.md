## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Equitable Urban Mobility Finance Platform

**UK AI Agent Hackathon Ep2 - Stellar Bounty Submission**

This document details the AI integration features that make our platform uniquely equitable and address urban mobility inequities.

## üéØ AI Integration Overview

Our platform leverages AI oracles and machine learning algorithms to create a truly equitable urban mobility finance system. The AI components ensure that underserved communities receive fair access to transportation solutions while maintaining sustainable returns for investors.

## üß† Core AI Features

### 1. AI-Driven Equity Scoring

**Location**: `contracts/loan_pool/src/lib.rs` - `calculate_equity_score()`
**Location**: `contracts/equity_rate_adjuster/src/lib.rs` - `calculate_equity_score()`

**How it works:**
- Analyzes urban data including income levels, pollution, public transport access, and population density
- Generates equity scores (0-100) that determine loan rate adjustments and revenue bonuses
- Ensures underserved areas automatically receive higher equity scores

**AI Algorithm:**
```rust
fn calculate_equity_score(env: &Env, urban_data: &UrbanData) -> i32 {
    let mut score = 0;
    
    // Lower income areas get higher equity scores
    score += (11 - urban_data.income_level) * 10;
    
    // Higher pollution areas get higher equity scores (more need for clean transport)
    score += urban_data.pollution_level * 5;
    
    // Lower public transport access gets higher equity scores
    score += (11 - urban_data.public_transport_score) * 8;
    
    // Higher population density gets moderate equity boost
    score += urban_data.population_density * 3;
    
    // Normalize to 0-100 range
    score = score / 4;
    if score > 100 { score = 100; }
    
    score
}
```

### 2. AI-Adjusted Loan Rates

**Location**: `contracts/equity_rate_adjuster/src/lib.rs` - `calculate_adjusted_rate()`

**How it works:**
- Uses equity scores to dynamically adjust interest rates
- Higher equity scores result in lower rates for underserved communities
- Additional adjustments based on environmental and social impact factors

**Rate Adjustment Logic:**
```rust
fn calculate_adjusted_rate(env: &Env, base_rate: &i32, equity_score: &i32, urban_data: &UrbanData) -> i32 {
    // Higher equity scores get lower rates
    let equity_adjustment = (100 - equity_score) * data.max_rate_adjustment / 100;
    
    // Additional adjustments based on urban factors
    let mut additional_adjustment = 0;
    
    // Lower income areas get additional rate reduction
    if urban_data.income_level <= 3 {
        additional_adjustment -= 5;
    }
    
    // Higher pollution areas get additional rate reduction
    if urban_data.pollution_level >= 8 {
        additional_adjustment -= 3;
    }
    
    // Poor public transport access gets additional rate reduction
    if urban_data.public_transport_score <= 3 {
        additional_adjustment -= 4;
    }
    
    let total_adjustment = equity_adjustment + additional_adjustment;
    let adjusted_rate = base_rate - total_adjustment;
    
    // Ensure rate doesn't go below 1%
    if adjusted_rate < 1 { 1 } else { adjusted_rate }
}
```

### 3. Equity-Weighted Revenue Distribution

**Location**: `contracts/revenue_distributor/src/lib.rs` - `calculate_equity_bonus()`

**How it works:**
- Distributes ride revenue with equity bonuses
- Investors in underserved areas receive higher returns
- Rewards social impact through bonus calculations

**Equity Bonus Calculation:**
```rust
fn calculate_equity_bonus(
    env: &Env,
    equity_bonus_pool: &i128,
    equity_score: &i32,
    underserved_rides: &i32,
    total_rides: &i32,
) -> i128 {
    // Base equity bonus based on equity score
    let base_bonus = equity_bonus_pool * equity_score / 100;
    
    // Additional bonus for underserved area focus
    let underserved_bonus = if total_rides > 0 {
        let underserved_ratio = underserved_rides * 100 / total_rides;
        base_bonus * underserved_ratio / 100
    } else {
        0
    };
    
    base_bonus + underserved_bonus
}
```

### 4. AI-Enhanced Governance

**Location**: `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` - `calculate_equity_boost()`

**How it works:**
- Equity-weighted voting power for community governance
- Voters with higher equity scores get voting power boosts
- Ensures fair representation in platform decisions

**Voting Power Calculation:**
```rust
fn calculate_equity_boost(env: &Env, voter_data: &VoterData, proposal: &Proposal) -> i128 {
    // Only give equity boost if voter's equity score meets threshold
    if voter_data.equity_score >= proposal.equity_boost_threshold {
        // Calculate boost as percentage of base voting power
        let boost_percentage = data.equity_boost_multiplier - 100; // 50% boost
        voter_data.voting_power * boost_percentage / 100
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

## üìä AI Data Sources

### Urban Data Integration

Our AI system processes the following urban data points:

1. **Income Levels** (1-10 scale)
   - Determines base equity scoring
   - Influences rate adjustments

2. **Pollution Levels** (1-10 scale)
   - Higher pollution areas get priority
   - Environmental impact consideration

3. **Public Transport Access** (1-10 scale)
   - Poor access areas get higher equity scores
   - Addresses transportation deserts

4. **Population Density** (1-10 scale)
   - High-density areas get moderate boosts
   - Efficiency considerations

### Real-Time Oracle Integration

**Mock Implementation for Demo:**
```rust
fn generate_mock_urban_data(env: &Env, location: &Symbol) -> UrbanData {
    let location_str = location.to_string();
    let hash = env.crypto().sha256(&location_str.as_bytes());
    
    // Generate deterministic but varied data based on location
    let income_level = ((hash[0] as i32) % 10) + 1;
    let pollution_level = ((hash[1] as i32) % 10) + 1;
    let public_transport_score = ((hash[2] as i32) % 10) + 1;
    let population_density = ((hash[3] as i32) % 10) + 1;

    UrbanData {
        location: location.clone(),
        income_level,
        pollution_level,
        public_transport_score,
        population_density,
        timestamp: env.ledger().timestamp(),
    }
}
```

**Production Implementation:**
In a production environment, this would integrate with:
- City government APIs
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Public transport data feeds
- Census and demographic data
- Real-time traffic and pollution sensors
