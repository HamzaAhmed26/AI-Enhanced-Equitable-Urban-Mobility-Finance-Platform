# AI-Enhanced Equitable Urban Mobility Finance Platform

## 🚀 UK AI Agent Hackathon Ep2 - Stellar Bounty Submission

**Bounty**: Ill right the Rules (750 USDC)  
**Sponsor**: Stellar  
**Platform**: Stellar Soroban Smart Contracts

## 🌟 Project Overview

This platform addresses urban mobility inequities by using AI-driven equitable loan rates and transparent revenue distribution to finance shared urban mobility assets (e-bikes, shuttles) in underserved communities.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
In major cities, low-income communities face unequal access to affordable, sustainable transportation due to:
- High costs and biased loan approvals
- Centralized ride-sharing platforms
- Traditional finance excluding many from investing in shared mobility solutions

### 💡 Solution
A decentralized platform on Stellar's Soroban that:
- Crowdfunds mobility assets via community loans
- Uses AI oracles to adjust interest rates equitably (lower for underserved areas)
- Distributes ride revenues transparently with social impact bonuses
- Prioritizes equitable access to urban mobility

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Soroban/Rust)
1. **LoanPool** - Manages crowdfunding contributions and pool balance
2. **EquityRateAdjuster** - AI oracle integration for equitable rate adjustments
3. **RevenueDistributor** - Equity-weighted revenue distribution
4. **Governance** - DAO voting with equity-weighted logic

### AI Integration
- **AI Oracle**: Dynamically adjusts loan rates based on urban data (income levels, traffic patterns, pollution)
- **Equity Scoring**: Boosts voting power and revenue shares for low-income participants
- **Impact Analytics**: Real-time tracking of social impact metrics

## 🚀 Features

### High Priority
- ✅ **Crowdfunding Pool**: Stake XLM/USDC to fund mobility assets
- ✅ **AI-Adjusted Loan Rates**: Dynamic rates based on urban equity data
- ✅ **Revenue Sharing**: Transparent distribution with equity bonuses

### Medium Priority
- ✅ **Community Governance**: Equity-weighted voting on platform decisions
- ✅ **Impact Dashboard**: Real-time social impact visualization

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Rust + Soroban SDK
- **Blockchain**: Stellar Futurenet
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **AI Tools**: OpenZeppelin AI Wizard, Stella AI
- **Testing**: Soroban CLI + Rust tests
